**Clock**

This simple analogue clock app was inspired by an already made project. The main goal was to freshen up HTML, CSS, a little bit of JavaScript and learn new tricks and details.

While making this app, I stumbled upon an idea to create a digital clock from scratch. If I find the time to do it, it will be linked here in the future.

**Introduction**

To run the app:

* Clone the app to your local machine
* Make sure you have opened it on Visual Studio Code
* To run the live-server press ALT+L+O
* (or press the "Go Live" button on the lower right-hand sight)
* The browser should open automatically
